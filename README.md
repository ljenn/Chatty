## Overview
### Description
Chatty is a Tinder Clone. It lets the user sign up and log in, giving them access to a feed of user profiles. The user can then interact with the profile to chat with them.

### App Evaluation

- **Category:** Lifestyle / Social Networking

- **Mobile:** iOS

- **Story:** The story is compelling! There is demand in finding friends. Loneliness is a increasing problem in younger generations, so a mobile app that connects people effectively would be extremely valuable. Friends and peers will likely think it's another dating app, but that also indicates that there is demand for the service.

- **Market:** Social networking category is a multi-billion dollar industry in the United States, though it is not unique. The target market of 33 million people (age 18-30) without close friends in the United States, and that is the potential user base. If effective, this app would provide a huge value to people searching for connections. 

- **Habit:** With a user-friendly interface, we want to design a feature that allows a user to update their activity, and this would also encourage other users to keep coming back to check out what local users are up to. Average users would check a few times a day whenever they are triggered by boredom, negative feelings, or curiosity. Users can create content as they customize and update their profiles. 

- **Scope:** The app would include features needed for common social app.  The vision of the final product is similar to a Tinder clone, and the app will heavily rely on communication with the backend database. Completing the app should be manageable. A simple version would still be interesting and provide an in-demand service.
